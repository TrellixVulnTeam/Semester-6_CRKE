Prerequisite: Probability Theory and Algorithms.
  

1. Outline: With the rapid growth of digital communication and electronic 
       data exchange, information security becomes a crucial problem in 
       the industries, business, and administration. Data exchanged over 
       the public networks (Internet) must be kept confidential and 
       protected against manipulations. Electronic business requires
       digital signatures that are valid in law, and secure payment-protocols. 
       Coming to the 4th industrial technology revolution, digital assets 
       become more valuable and people will look into blockchain more. 
       Modern days cryptography is ubiquitous and plays a key role in 
       providing solutions for data privacy and integrity. 


2. Objectives: In this course, students will learn security issues of 
      communications, classical cryptographic algorithms, symmetric-key 
      cryptography, public-key cryptography, digital signatures, and the 
      real-life applications. At the end of this course, students will 
      know how to apply cryptographic techniques in the design and 
      analysis of secure distributed systems.


3. Course Outline (Topics): The following list of topics is tentative. 
      Based on available time slots, some topics may be dropped or 
      added or reordered.

    - Number Theory Basics: Modular arithmetic, Primes, Euclidean Algorithm,               Chinese Remainder Theorem.

    - Shannon’s Theory: Perfect Secrecy, Entropy, Security analysis of 
             Classical ciphers.
 
    - Symmetric Key Cryptography: DES, Finite Fields, AES, Security Analysis.

    - Public Key Cryptography: RSA, ElGamal, Elliptic Curve Cryptography.

    - Digital Signatures: Hash functions, Proof-of-Work, Merkle/Hash Tree, 
              Digital Signature Algorithm, ElGamal Digital Signature.

    - Blockchain: Introduction to Blockchain, Double Spending Problem (Fork), 
              Bitcoin Transactions, Mining, Hash puzzle solving, 
              Consensus (Byzantine Generals Problem and Practical BFT), 
              Security Issues of Blockchain.

6. Industry Impact: Cryptography is an essential component of cybersecurity.
      The need to protect sensitive information and ensure the integrity of
      industrial control processes has placed a premium on cybersecurity
      skills in today’s information technology market. The global bersecurity
      market is currently worth $173B in 2020, growing to $270B by 2026. By         2026, 77% of cybersecurity spending will be for externally managed
      security services.  While money spent on in-house or internal
      cybersecurity functions is expected to grow 7.2% each year to 2026,
      global spending on external cybersecurity products and services is
      projected to increase by 8.4% annually over the same period (Source:
      Australian Cyber Security Growth Network - forbes)
